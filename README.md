## HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is a repository for Tech Academy HTML and CSS project work to demonstrate HTML and CSS projects. 

## Note about folder/file structure and organization
I reorganized the folders to improve navigation and help myself with file-path setup. Assignments are within the Assignment folder and Challenges are in the "asides" folder.
