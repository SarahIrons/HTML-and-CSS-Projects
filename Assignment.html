<p>Why you should <em>eat more mushrooms </em></p>
<h1>Mushrooms contain protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</h1>
<h1>Mushrooms are distinct as the sole vegan source of nonfortified vitamin D.</h1>
		<h3>There are countless ways to incorporate mushrooms into cooking--such as sauteing, adding to a stir-fry, or adding to a sandwich, salad or soup.</h3>

		<p>Fungi Are Genetically Closer to Humans Than Plants
		
		In the past, scientists considered fungi to be plants, but now we know better. Discoveries show that fungi are more closely related to animals, including humans, than to plants.

		Here are some of the things that make fungi more like animals:	
		They absorb nutrients from organic matter, unlike plants that produce their food through photosynthesis.
		Fungi have a fibrous substance called chitin in their cell walls, the same as animals. Plants do not.
		Like us, fungi need food, water and oxygen to survive. They use their hyphae to absorb nutrients, water, and oxygen from their surroundings and expel waste products and CO2.</h3></p>
