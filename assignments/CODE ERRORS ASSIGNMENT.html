<!--Notes: 
1)Set language for page and set as doc type; incl char set
2)typo "ed" in title; also it is listed as a header but does not appear to be a header otherwise--looks like this is intended to be "head" instead
3)open tags were closed
4)spelling error in "this" 
5)the border styling is dashed as indidicated in the written assignment notes--however it also reads as dotted in the visual display. this could be a potential variable.
